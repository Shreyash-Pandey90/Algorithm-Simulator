This repository contains an Algorithm Simulator that implements various sorting algorithms, array operations, stack operations, and queue operations. It is a tool designed to help you visualize and understand how these algorithms and data structures work.

## <div align="center">🔍 Sorting</div>
Visualize and compare different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort.

## <div align="center">🔢 Array</div>
Perform common array operations like searching, inserting, deleting, and updating elements.

## <div align="center">📚 Stack</div>
Simulate stack operations including push, pop, and peek.

## <div align="center">🔄 Queue and Circular Queue</div>
Experience queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and front/back element retrieval.
