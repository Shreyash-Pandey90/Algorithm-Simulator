#** Algorithm-Simulator**


This repository contains an Algorithm Simulator that implements various sorting algorithms, array operations, stack operations, and queue operations. It is a tool designed to help you visualize and understand how these algorithms and data structures work.


SORTING------------------------------>
Visualize and compare different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort.

ARRAY--------------------------------->
Perform common array operations like searching, inserting, deleting, and updating elements.

STACK----------------------------------->
Simulate stack operations including push, pop, and peek.

QUEUE AND CIRCULAR QUEUE---------------------------------->
Experience queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and front/back element retrieval.
